# RayTracingSimulation
This code simulates black holes and its surrounding, specifically the disk and corona of black holes, and tracks photons from where they originated close to the black hole to the observer. The code has been updated over the years to includ simulation of different black hole characterization and it is available at: https://gitlab.com/krawcz/kerrc-x-ray-fitting-code

As an output, the code saves various physical propoerties of the photons such as, time, location, energy, stockes paramters, etc. The output of the simulation is then analyzed in the analysis.c code using ROOT interface to visualize and meaure different physical behaviour of the black hole and its surrounding.
