# Simulation of Black Holes
This code simulates black holes and their surroundings, specifically modeling the disk and corona of black holes. It tracks photons from their origin near the black hole to the observer. The code has undergone updates over the years to include simulations of various black hole characteristics and is accessible at: https://gitlab.com/krawcz/kerrc-x-ray-fitting-code

As a result, the code saves various physical properties of the photons, including time, location, energy, Stokes parameters, and more. The simulation output is subsequently analyzed in the "analysis.c" code using the ROOT interface to visualize and measure different physical behaviors of the black hole and its surroundings.
